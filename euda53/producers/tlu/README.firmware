The EUDET TLU is based in the Orange Tree ZestSC1 FPGA board. With this board the FPGA configuration is downloaded over USB at start-up. 

Additonally to the libusb library, the TLU producer for the EUDET TLU requires the ZestSC1 driver package and the FPGA firmware bitfiles (The *.bit files are produced by Xilinx ISE.); these are available to download via AFS from DESY.

If AFS is accessible on the machine when CMake is run, the necessary files will be installed automatically; otherwise, manually copy full folder with sub-directories from
* /afs/desy.de/group/telescopes/tlu/ZestSC1  
* /afs/desy.de/group/telescopes/tlu/tlufirmware
into the ./extern subfolder in your EUDAQ source directory.
